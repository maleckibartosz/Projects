During this project I've tested both process of registration and modules found in the project documentation consistent with the rights of the managerial account, such as:

* Registration,
* Login & Log out,
* New/Edit/Delete Customer,
* New/Edit/Delete Account,
* Deposit,
* Withdrawal,
* Fund Transfer,
* Change Password,
* Balance Enquiry,
* Mini Statement and
* Customised Statement.
